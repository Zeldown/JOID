JOID is built upon the Universal Tween Engine, a powerful and versatile animation engine created by [Aur√©lien Ribon](https://github.com/AurelienRibon).<br>
The font rendering technology used in this project is helped by [msdfgen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen) for the msdf generator.

## MSDF-Generator

```bash
msdf-atlas-gen.exe -font font.ttf -charset charset.txt -dimensions 2048 2048 -imageout font.png -json font.json -type msdf -pxrange 24 -coloringstrategy distance
